  abstract = {The high rates of urban growth in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s produced rapid urbanization and housing problems. In developing countries, planning policies as well as the research community have approached urban growth as a static problem rather than as a spatial form that emerges from the urban development process and that is part of a constant dynamic process. This paper focuses on a specific kind of urban growth that happens in Latin American cities, called `peripherisation'. This is characterized by the formation of low-income residential areas in the peripheral ring of the city and a perpetuation of a dynamic core-periphery spatial pattern. The dynamics of growth and change in Latin American cities are explored using agent-based simulation. The objective is to increase the understanding of urban spatial phenomena in Latin American cities, which is essential to providing a basis for future planning actions and policies. The first part of the chapter presents a brief overview of urban growth and dynamics in Latin American cities. The Peripherisation Model is introduced, and its implementation and evaluation described. Simulation exercises were used to revisit assumptions about urbanization issues in Latin American cities and investigate important aspects of growth and change in these cities. These exercises allowed the problem of urban growth in Latin American cities to be unfolded through their dynamics, relating these dynamics to urban morphology, and thus presenting a new and important perspective on the phenomenon.},

However, the policies that helped to produce this fertility decline have had a number of undesirable consequences, particularly the social and economic costs imposed on China's families. This paper considers problems with and alternatives to China's birth limitation programs. Accepting as given the Chinese government's goal of stabilizing the population at 1.2 billion by the year 2000, the paper first reviews the likely potential demographic and socioeconomic effects of current and past policies. It then explores policy alternatives, mostly variants of a stop-at-two rule, and their benefits compared with the current one-child policy. The overall aim is to demonstrate that a two-child policy, if accompanied by delayed childbearing, can be as effective as the one-child policy in achieving China's macrodemographic goals. The projections in this study demonstrate that it is possible to limit population size to less than 1.2 billion in 2000 under a strictly enforced stop-at-two policy with a minimum age at first birth of as low as 25 years. While the two-child policy would be as effective in limiting population size as the one-child policy, it would be easier to implement and would have less detrimental consequences for the society and economy.]},

  abstract = {Between 1998 and 2008 European countries experienced the first continent-wide increase in the period total fertility rate (TFR) since the 1960s. After discussing period and cohort influences on fertility trends, we examine the role of tempo distortions of period fertility and different methods for removing them. We highlight the usefulness of a new indicator: the tempo- and parity-adjusted total fertility rate (TFRp*). This variant of the adjusted total fertility rate proposed by Bongaarts and Feeney also controls for the parity composition of the female population and provides more stable values than the indicators proposed in the past. Finally, we estimate levels and trends in tempo and parity distribution distortions in selected countries in Europe. Our analysis of period and cohort fertility indicators in the Czech Republic, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden shows that the new adjusted measure gives a remarkable fit with the completed fertility of women in prime childbearing years in a given period, which suggests that it provides an accurate adjustment for tempo and parity composition distortions. Using an expanded dataset for ten countries, we demonstrate that adjusted fertility as measured by TFRp* remained nearly stable since the late 1990s. This finding implies that the recent upturns in the period TFR in Europe are largely explained by a decline in the pace of fertility postponement. Other tempo-adjusted fertility indicators have not indicated such a large role for the diminishing tempo effect in these TFR upturns. As countries proceed through their postponement transitions, tempo effects will decline further and eventually disappear, thus putting continued upward pressure on period fertility. However, such an upward trend may be obscured for a few years by the effects of economic recession.},

  abstract = {This study provides information on sex ratio at birth (SRB) reference levels and SRB imbalance. Using a comprehensive database and a Bayesian estimation model, we estimate that SRB reference levels are significantly different from the commonly assumed historical norm of 1.05 for most regions. We identify 12 countries with strong statistical evidence of SRB imbalance: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, China, Georgia, Hong Kong (SAR of China), India, Republic of Korea, Montenegro, Taiwan (Province of China), Tunisia, and Vietnam.The sex ratio at birth (SRB; ratio of male to female live births) imbalance in parts of the world over the past few decades is a direct consequence of sex-selective abortion, driven by the coexistence of son preference, readily available technology of prenatal sex determination, and fertility decline. Estimation of the degree of SRB imbalance is complicated because of unknown SRB reference levels and because of the uncertainty associated with SRB observations. There are needs for reproducible methods to construct SRB estimates with uncertainty, and to assess SRB inflation due to sex-selective abortion. We compile an extensive database from vital registration systems, censuses and surveys with 10,835 observations, and 16,602 country-years of information from 202 countries. We develop Bayesian methods for SRB estimation for all countries from 1950 to 2017. We model the SRB regional and national reference levels, the fluctuation around national reference levels, and the inflation. The estimated regional reference levels range from 1.031 (95\% uncertainty interval [1.027; 1.036]) in sub-Saharan Africa to 1.063 [1.055; 1.072] in southeastern Asia, 1.063 [1.054; 1.072] in eastern Asia, and 1.067 [1.058; 1.077] in Oceania. We identify 12 countries with strong statistical evidence of SRB imbalance during 1970\textendash 2017, resulting in 23.1 [19.0; 28.3] million missing female births globally. The majority of those missing female births are in China, with 11.9 [8.5; 15.8] million, and in India, with 10.6 [8.0; 13.6] million.},

  abstract = {Background Spatial Interaction Models have been used for decades to explain and predict flows (of migrants, capital, traffic, trade etc.) between geographic locations. Aims This paper will guide users through the process of fitting and calibrating spatial interaction models in order to understand, explain and predict internal migration flows in Australia. Data and methods Internal migration data from the Australian 2011 Census of Population and Housing, which records people who have moved between Greater Capital City Statistical Areas over 5-year periods, is used to exemplify the modelling process. The R statistical software is used to process and visualise the data as well as run the models.
Results The full suite of Wilson's family of spatial interaction models is fitted to the internal migration data, revealing that distance and origin/destination populations are some of the most important influencing factors affecting internal migration flows. We see whether constraining the model to known flows about origins and/or destinations will improve the fits and model estimates.
Conclusions Spatial interaction modelling has been a tool in the box of some population geographers for a number of decades. However, recent advances in more forgiving programming languages such as R and Python now mean that this powerful modelling methodology is no longer only available to those who also possess advanced computer programming skills. This guide has exemplified the process of fitting and calibrating spatial interaction models on Australian internal migration data, but the methods could easily be applied to other flow data sets in other contexts.},

little research has yet been done on the factors associated with younger generations'
preference for these types of unions. This paper analyses the changes in the profle of
young cohabitants in Uruguay between 1990 and 2015, using a descriptive approach
based on cross-sectional information extracted from the Continuous Household Survey
to look at men and women between 20 and 34 years of age. It also employs multivariate
models to estimate the probability of being in a consensual union depending on
different attributes. The results confrm that the increase in cohabitation is a generational
phenomenon involving young people from all socioeconomic levels. There are certain
social traits associated with consensual unions, however; for example, they tend to be
more frequent among those with low education levels, although this social gradient
tends to dissipate over time as demographic characteristics (such as age and having
children) become more decisive in the choice of union type. The article concludes that
broader research is needed on the characteristics and trajectories of cohabitants, which
requires suitable longitudinal information and more qualitative research.},

  abstract = {This article examines some of the basic elements of spatial interaction models. Spatial interaction is the general term for any movement of people, goods, or information over space that results from a decision-making process. Specific examples include movements such as migration, shopping trips, commuting, trips for recreational purposes, trips for educational purposes, freight flows, the spatial pattern of telephone calls, emails and world-wide web connections, and even the use of healthcare facilities. Spatial interaction models are mathematical descriptions of spatial flows. The models serve two purposes. One is to predict flows where they are unknown such as the impact on traffic patterns of a new development or the impact of a new retail outlet or healthcare facility. The other is to yield information on the determinants of the flow system being analyzed. For example, spatial interaction models are commonly used by retailers to determine the influence of various store attributes on the choice of stores by consumers or by government agencies to examine the characteristics of places which affect in and out migration. This article describes four common types of spatial interaction models and outlines a typical application of each type of model. Brief discussions of model calibration and local forms of spatial interaction models are then given followed by a description of the various underlying theoretical structures that have been proposed to substantiate spatial interaction models.},

  abstract = {Child underreporting is often neglected in studies of fertility and sex ratio imbalance in China. To improve estimates of these measures, I use intercensal comparisons to identify a rise in underreporting, which followed the increased enforcement and penalization under the birth planning system in 1991. A new triangulation of evidence indicates that about 19\% of children at ages 0\textendash 4 were unreported in the 2000 census, more than double that of the 1990 census. This evidence contradicts assumptions underlying the fertility estimates of most recent studies. Yet, the analysis also suggests that China's fertility in the late 1990s (and perhaps beyond) was below officially adjusted levels. I then conduct a similar intercensal analysis of sex ratios of births and children, which are the world's highest primarily because of prenatal sex selection. However, given excess underreporting of young daughters, especially pronounced just after 1990, estimated ratios are lower than reported ratios. Sex ratios in areas with a ``1.5-child'' policy are especially distorted because of excess daughter underreporting, as well as sex-linked stopping rules and other factors, although it is unclear whether such policies increase use of prenatal sex selection. China's sex ratio at birth, once it is standardized by birth order, fell between 2000 and 2005 and showed a continuing excess in urban China, not rural China.},

Data from the United States Census Bureau suggests there has been a rise in assortative mating. Additionally, assortative mating affects household income inequality. In particular, if matching in 2005 between husbands and wives had been random, instead of the pattern observed in the data, then the Gini coefficient would have fallen from the observed 0.43 to 0.34, so that income inequality would be smaller. Thus, assortative mating is important for income inequality. The high level of married female labor-force participation in 2005 is important for this result.},

It first describes and compares the most recent birth statistics in Asia in order to identify commonalities in the gradual rise of SRBs observed from Armenia to South Korea. This comparison provides the basis for identifying specific transition patterns in the changes in SRBs. Their recent rise is then interpreted in a social and historical framework borrowed from fertility decline and based on three preconditions: access to sex-selection technology, preference for male births, and pressure from low fertility. On a broader plane, the process of growing imbalances in the sex composition of the population gives rise to a tragedy of the commons. This article indicates the factors that appear most likely to trigger a turnaround in this transitional demographic situation and to facilitate a return to biologically normal sex ratios in the future.},

I use population projections from 2005 to 2100 based on three different scenarios for the sex ratio at birth (SRB). To counteract the limitations of cross-sectional methods commonly used to assess the severity of marriage squeezes, I use a two-sex cohort-based procedure to simulate marriage patterns over the twenty-first century based on the female dominance model. I also examine two more-flexible marriage functions to illustrate the potential impact of changes in marriage schedules as a response to the marriage squeeze. Longitudinal indicators of marriage squeeze indicate that the number of prospective grooms in both countries will exceed that of prospective brides by more 50\% for three decades in the most favorable scenario. Rates of male bachelorhood will not peak before 2050, and the squeeze conditions will be felt several decades thereafter, even among cohorts unaffected by adverse SRB. If the SRB is allowed to return to normalcy by 2020, the proportion of men unmarried at age 50 is expected to rise to 15\% in China by 2055 and to 10\% in India by 2065. India suffers from the additional impact of a delayed fertility transition on its age structures.},

Our focus is on the association between the social class origins of the partners. The propensity towards assortative mating is taken as an index of the openness of society which we regard as a macro level aspect of social inequality. There is some evidence that the propensity for partners to come from similar class backgrounds declined during the 1960s. Thereafter, there was a period of 40 years of remarkable stability during which the propensity towards assortative mating fluctuated trendlessly within quite narrow limits. This picture of stability over time in social openness parallels the wellestablished facts about intergenerational social class mobility in Britain.},

It first argues that geographers, with their broad-ranging subject matter, epistemological pluralism, and varied research methods, are ideally placed to carry out migration research and advance migration theory. Second, the paper casts a retrospective view at some highlights of geographers' theoretical contributions to migration. The third part reviews the recent and current states of play, which have seen a shift in the geographical study of migration from population geography to cultural geography, via the ?cultural turn?. Four paradigmatic trends in the study of migration are reviewed ? the mobilities turn, transnationalism, diaspora studies, and gendered approaches ? and geographers' contributions to each of these are evaluated. The conclusion looks to the future, asks whether the cultural turn is over and, in the light of the global economic crisis, identifies new avenues of migration research for migration geographers.

Four events after the first live birth are used to evaluate compliance with the policy: (1) certificate acceptance (an indicator of future fertility intention); (2) the use of contraceptives (an indicator of intention to prevent a subsequent pregnancy); (3) the occurrence of a pregnancy subsequent to the first live birth (a potential violation of the one child policy), and (4) among those pregnant, the likelihood of an abortion (an indicator of compliance by preventing a second live birth). It is found that son preference is still prevalent in China. Although the effect of son preference is not the most important, urbanization, education, and occupation have not fundamentally changed its influence on women's compliance. In addition, the effect of son preference on the compliance is not altered by government control. Preference for sons continues to be a factor discouraging the compliance with the one child policy.},

Further, since a number of Asian countries, China in particular, have high hepatitis B carrier rates, Oster (2005) suggested that hepatitis B could explain a large share \{ approximately 50\% \{ of Asia's \textbackslash missing women". Subsequent work has questioned this conclusion. Most notably, Lin and Luoh (2008) use data from a large cohort of births in Taiwan and find only a very tiny effect of maternal hepatitis carrier status on offspring sex ratio. Although this work is quite conclusive for the case of mothers, it leaves open the possibility that paternal carrier status is driving higher sex offspring sex ratios. To test this, we collected data on the offspring gender for a cohort of 67,000 people in China who are being observed in a prospective cohort study of liver cancer; approximately 15\% of these individuals are hepatitis B carriers. In this sample, we find no effect of either maternal or paternal hepatitis B carrier status on offspring sex. Carrier parents are no more likely to have male children than non-carrier parents. This finding leads us to conclude that hepatitis B cannot explain skewed sex ratios in China.\vphantom{\}\}}},

At the population level a rising sex ratio has been recorded; at the between-family level an inverse relationship between sex ratio and family size has been observed; and at the within-family level a rapidly rising sex ratio with birth order has been noted.

Official estimates are available for several base years: 1961; 1978; 1983; 1988 revision, 1997 and 2005, though each benchmark was constructed from different sources and methodologies. In our research, we accept the official series for 1997 onwards and used other techniques to link the different base series prior to 1997 and back to 1955. In this paper, we focus on the demand side and we pursue two objectives. On the first place, we propose homogeneous annual time-series of GDP, exports, imports, gross capital formation, household final consumption expenditure and consumption of general government between 1955 and 2016, at current and at constant prices. We employ two splicing techniques: retropolation and interpolation. On the second place, we discuss the differences of the spliced series, for each variable, in terms of levels, growth rates and expenditure structure of GDP. Finally, we suggest that interpolation may be a better procedure than retroplation to obtain homogeneous national accounts time-series for this historical period in Uruguay.},

Global transitions in fertility, mortality, and urbanisation are examined as background to the idea of a migration transition and its variants. The strengths and weaknesses of a transition approach to migration are outlined, focusing on the diffusion of a demographic process across space and through time. The concepts of ?mobility? and ?migration? transitions are assessed with the benefit of hindsight. In order to enhance the explanatory power of such transitions, I argue that they need to be linked with other economic, social, and political processes that are also diffusing in space and time. Agrarian, health, and gender transitions are briefly considered in this context, as is the whole question of migration and development. While no single pathway through any migration or developmental transition exists, it nevertheless needs to be accepted that a retreat to total relativism is counterproductive. The paper concludes by arguing that a transitional framework, which allows migration systems to be linked to wider socio-economic change, provides a fertile environment in which to generate future theories of migration.

  author = {Varela, Carmen},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {En los \'ultimos a\~nos se observan cambios fundamentales en la din\'amica demogr\'afica del Uruguay. El pa\'is tradicionalmente ha sido considerado como poseedor de una demograf\'ia "moderna", que comenz\'o a fines del siglo xix una primera transici\'on. En las \'ultimas d\'ecadas del siglo xx, aparecen algunos de los rasgos fundamentales de la llamada "segunda transici\'on demogr\'afica" que se identifica con la posmodernidad y los procesos de globalizaci\'on. Este estudio permite identificar algunas de las transformaciones que se est\'an operando en la sociedad: -Se acent\'ua el proceso de envejecimiento de la estructura de edades caracterizado por un incremento de la proporci\'on de adultos mayores y la reducci\'on de los ni\~nos. -La tasa global de fecundidad se ubic\'o por debajo del nivel de reemplazo de la poblaci\'on, lo que se traduce en que la poblaci\'on no tiene la capacidad de sustituirse a s\'i misma, ya que no repone a las mujeres que son las futuras procreadoras. -Los cambios en la familia, la nupcialidad y la fecundidad alteran considerablemente el panorama demogr\'afico del pa\'is. Entre ellos, el retraso de la transici\'on a la adultez de los j\'ovenes uruguayos incide en la postergaci\'on del matrimonio y del primer hijo. -Montevideo sigue teniendo primac\'ia en cuanto a concentraci\'on de la poblaci\'on, mientras que Maldonado, Canelones y San Jos\'e se han transformado en la principal zona receptora de migrantes internos y es la nueva "competidora" de la capital como pivote migratorio. -Los saldos migratorios internacionales se mantienen negativos. La emigraci\'on, que se instal\'o como un rasgo estructural de la sociedad uruguaya a partir de la d\'ecada de 1960, se aceler\'o de manera importante durante la \'ultima d\'ecada. -Un rasgo com\'un a las variables que se han estudiado es su heterogeneidad de comportamiento en lo relacionado con el estatus social y el nivel educativo. El estudio de estos temas fue llevado a cabo en base a la informaci\'on que surge de la Encuesta Nacional de Hogares Ampliada de 2006 realizada por el Instituto Nacional de Estad\'istica. Los autores son docentes del Programa de Poblaci\'on de la Facultad de Ciencias Sociales de la Universidad de la Rep\'ublica, \'unico centro de investigaci\'on en demograf\'ia del pa\'is. Esta publicaci\'on ha contado con el apoyo del Fondo de Poblaci\'on de las Naciones Unidas (unfpa), agencia de cooperaci\'on internacional para el desarrollo que promueve el derecho de cada persona a disfrutar de una vida sana con igualdad de oportunidades para todos.}

Basic concepts of such models can be developed in a variety of ways, and these are illustrated. The paper then outlines a number of other theoretical developments, and is particularly concerned with the disaggregation of such models, with the incorporation of time variables, and with the relation of spatial interaction, to more general, models. Uses of spatial interaction models are outlined briefly and the final section of the paper draws a number of conclusions and presents a summary.},

  abstract = {Race and class factors have been studied as underlying causes of segregation for many years. Individual choices on race and economic constraints of living in one area versus another play an important role in residential segregation. An attempt has not yet been made to simulate the interplay of neighbourhood racial and economic composition in forming segregation using empirical micro-level data. Using City of Buffalo data, this study explores how individuals? housing location choices with respect to racial composition and housing sale prices in their neighbourhoods can give rise to aggregate patterns of residential segregation and how segregation at one point in time was contributing to increased segregation at later stages. The results show that observed patterns of segregation in the city could plausibly arise from the interaction of racial and economic factors. This study also demonstrates the application of such models on exploring the possible effects of proposed integration efforts.},
